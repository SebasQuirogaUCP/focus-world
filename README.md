## About

Focus World is a powerful and elegant productivity app inspired by the Pomodoro Technique. It helps you stay focused and maintain optimal productivity by breaking your work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length (a "Pomodoro"), separated by short breaks. This technique enhances your concentration and minimizes burnout.

- **Pomodoro Timer** 🚦: Set custom work and break durations according to your preference.
- **Progress Tracking** 🥹: Visualize your work patterns and productivity trends over time.
- **Task List** 🧐: Organize your tasks for the day and assign them to individual Pomodoros.
- **Notifications** 🤭: Get gentle reminders for work and break times to stay on track.
- **Customizable Themes** 🤩: Personalize the app with light, dark, and vibrant color themes.
